## What Is WolframCA? ##

This is an android app which displays the successive 'generations' of a one-dimensional cellular
automaton (CA).  This was inspired by chapter 6 of Allen B. Downey's excellent book, 
'*Think Complexity*', where he describes the set of CAs, as presented by Steven Wolfram in a set of 
early 1980s papers.

* *Wolfram Mathwold*'s page '[Elementary Cellular Automaton](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html)'
	has an excellent summary of the topic.
* '*Think Complexity*' is freely downloadable as a PDF from [the publisher's bookpage](http://www.greenteapress.com/compmod/). 

**[Version 1.4 of the app is available in the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nologin.meep.ca)**, 
and supports devices running Android **2.3.3** (API Level: 10, GINGERBREAD_MR1) or greater.
